Please write C# console code that will allow the user to provide a date and time on the command line and then the code will generate a string output of the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds since the date time provided. It should produce the string every 5 seconds after starting until the user terminates the console app.

I noticed that the code was using the while loop with Thread.Sleep so it was blocking
I asked Copilot to re-write the code  with the following prompt:

Please rewrite that code so it is non-blocking on the delay (thread.sleep).
